# Explring Data Structures: A CodeCademy Journey

This repository is a collection of implementations and tests for various data structures. The code is primarily based on the exercises and examples from the Data Structures and Algorithms course on <ins>**Codecademy**</ins>.

**Note**: While the code in this project is derived from the course, it has been modified and organized to better demonstrate the understanding of the data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures 
The project includes implementations for the following data structures:

1. Doubly Linked List
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Hash Map
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Max Heap
7. Graph

Each data structure is implemented in its own file, and test functions have been created in a seperate test file to validate their functionality. 

## Test File
The **'test_data_structures.py'** file contains test functions for each of the data structures. The test functions create instances of the corresponding data structures, insert elements, perform operations, and test the expected behavior.

To run the tests, simply execute the **'test_data_structures.py'** script:
```
python test_data_structures.py
```
